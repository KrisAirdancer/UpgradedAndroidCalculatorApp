# UpgradedAndroidCalculatorApp
 An Android Calculator App built entirely from scratch as practice after building one from a tutorial to make sure I actually learned something.
 
 This calculator has increased functionality and usabilty over the tutorial one I built. It is also pink. Because pink is cool.
